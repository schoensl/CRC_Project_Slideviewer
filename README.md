# CRC_Project_Slideviewer
Modifications on the openslide-multipanel example to get a helpful slideviewer for MIL labeling. It is hosted locally using flask and uses openslide. It can show annotation info for each slide in the sidebar, which enables faster editing than when trying to search and cross-reference each file by hand.
